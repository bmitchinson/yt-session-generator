Changes in this fork:
- I kept getting errors that I didn't understand and don't know async python well, so I had gpt5 put in some logs to help me understand.
- I only have use for the .webserver dockerfile for use with cobalt, so I intergrated the code build Dockerfile into it and deleted the original.
